            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <p>On Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, installing snapcraft is just a command away:</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>sudo apt install snapcraft</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="eight-col">
            <h2>Get setup with our examples</h2>
            <p>Run the following command in any directory:</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>snapcraft-examples</code></pre>
            <p>This is going to create a <code>snapcraft-examples</code> subdirectory, with a few projects just waiting to be snapped. The directory structure looks like:</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>$ cd snapcraft-examples
$ ls
01-hello-world-cli/
02-hello-world-service/
03-hello-world-desktop-devmode/
04-hello-world-desktop/
05-hello-world-combined/</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="eight-col">
            <h3>A hello world command line</h3>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>$ cd 01-hello-world-cli
$ snapcraft</code></pre>
            <p>This asks snapcraft to run through its lifecycle, building the project and packaging it into a snap that you can install and run on your Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS system:</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>$ sudo snap install hello-world-cli-<yourusername>*.snap --devmode</code></pre>
            <p>(Don&rsquo;t worry about --devmode for now, we will cover exactly what this is in the 4th example.)</p>
            <p>Let&rsquo;s run the application:</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>$ hello-world-cli-<yourusername>
Hello World!</code></pre>
            <p>Wasn&rsquo;t that easy? Let&rsquo;s dive into that <code>snapcraft.yaml</code>. This is where the rubber meets the road &mdash; where you specify the information necessary for snapcraft to put your snap together.</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>name: hello-world-cli-<your-username>
version: 0.1
summary: Hello World
Description:
 This demo is intended to show how to build your first snap
 This code is part of the snapcraft example tour at
 https://developer.ubuntu.com/snapcraft-getting-started</code></pre>
            <p>This is the snap&rsquo;s basic metadata. It includes information like the name of the snap, its human-readable version, a one-sentence summary, and a more verbose description. This metadata is what a user will see when browsing the store.</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>parts:
  hello:
    plugin: cmake
    source: src</code></pre>
            <p>We then create a hello part, which uses the cmake plugin. A plugin refers to a language or build system which snapcraft will use to drive the lifecycle (i.e.; pull, build and install your code). In this case, the code for this part lives in a src subdirectory while <code>snapcraft.yaml</code> is in the toplevel directory.</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>apps:
  hello-world-cli-<your-username>:
    command: hello</code></pre>
            <p><code>apps</code> gives you ways to expose your commands to your snap users. By default, no commands are available to them, so you need to set them explicitly. Here, this binary refers to the </code>hello</code> command, which was created in the build step of the hello part.
Since the app name matches the snap name, you can simply execute it like:</p>
            <pre class="command-line"><code>$ hello-world-cli-<your-username>
Hello world!</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div class="eight-col">
          <h2>A hello world service</h2>
          <p>Let&rsquo;s head over to your second example, a nodejs web service!</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>$ cd ../02-hello-world-service
$ snapcraft
$ sudo snap try snap/ --devmode</code></pre>
          <p>Head over to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> in your browser and you&rsqwuo;ll be warmly greeted by the running web service.</p>
          <p>Instead of running <code>snap install</code> we are going to use <code>snap try</code> with the snap directory. <code>snap try</code> will make the <code>snap</code> temporarily available to the system. By doing this you can quickly iterate on your project and have your changes reflected on the system, without ever installing a snap!</p>
          <p>Let&rsquo;s look at the interesting part of <code>snapcraft.yaml</code> now:</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>parts:
  hello:
    plugin: nodejs
    source: .</code></pre>
          <p>The <code>hello</code> part is using the nodejs plugin, which, as the name infers, is specialized for node projects. It will take all the npm information from <code>package.json</code>, including dependencies (if any) and install them alongside the rest of this part.</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>apps:
  hello-service:
    command: hello-world
    daemon: simple</code></pre>
          <p>We declared a <code>hello-world</code> app, and specify that it&rsquo;s a simple (i.e. non-forking) daemon (a service which starts at boot and keeps running on your system). This one is executing the hello-world command.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="eight-col">
          <h3>A hello world desktop app (devmode)</h3>
          <p>Our third example is a desktop Qt application, popping up a GUI window.</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>$ cd ../03-hello-world-desktop-devmode
$ snapcraft update
$ snapcraft
$ sudo snap try snap/ --devmode</code></pre>
          <p>You&rsquo;ll notice that we ran snapcraft update before running snapcraft. We did this because this example uses parts from the cloud, and we need to fetch the cache of those parts before we can actually build the project.</p>
          <p>Open the Unity dash, look for hello-world-desktop and click on it, and you should see a &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo; window show up.</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>apps:
  hello-world-desktop:
    command: qt5-launch hello-world-desktop</code></pre>
          <p><code>qt5-launch</code> is a tool that prepares the environment for launching the real application. Let&rsquo;s see where the <code>qt5-launch</code> and <code>hello-world-desktop</code> commands are coming from:</p>
          <pre class="command-line"></code>parts:
  hello-world:
    plugin: cmake
    source: src/
    build-packages:
      - qtbase5-dev
    stage-packages:
      # Here for the plugins-- they're not linked in automatically.
      - libqt5gui5
    after: [qt5conf] # A part in the cloud</code></pre>
          <p><code>build-packages</code> list the dependencies needed to build the contents of the snap. These aren&rsquo;t packed into the final snap. We&rsquo;ve specified <code>qtbase5-dev</code> here since that package contains headers, libraries, and tools needed to build our app.</p>
          <p><code>stage-packages</code> list the dependencies needed to actually run the contents of the snap. They&rsquo;ll be packed into the final snap. Here, we want the <code>hello-world</code> part to download and unpack <code>libqt5gui5</code> with all its dependencies. This method can be used to reuse any of the 48000 .deb packages that traditional Ubuntu provides! It&rsquo;s really that easy: just specify the packages you need embedded into your snap.</p>
          <p><code>after: [qt5conf]</code> lists the parts that must be staged before this part can be built. However, you may have noticed that this YAML doesnâ€™t actually contain the <code>qt5conf</code> part. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a part in the cloud, which is a way for collaborating, reusing and sharing already-written parts! The previously mentioned <code>qt5-launch</code> tool comes from the <code>qt5conf</code> part, without any additional effort from you.</p>
          <p>Since we&rsquo;re shipping a graphical application, we&rsquo;d like to be able to expose our application to the desktop with a desktop file. We do that by adding one in <code>setup/gui/hello-world-desktop.desktop</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="eight-col">
          <h3>A hello world desktop app</h3>
          <p>We mentioned earlier that we would explain this whole &ldquo;devmode&rdquo; thing. One of the primary features of snaps is the security they provide, but such security doesn&rsquo;t come for free. It isn&rsquo;t always easy to make an application that runs happily under full confinement; it can be very helpful to ignore that aspect of snaps while you&rsquo;re initially developing it. We do that by installing (or trying) snaps in &ldquo;devmode,&rdquo; which tells snappy to allow the snap to run unconfined. This allows for quick iteration to perfect the functionality of the snap before you need to worry about making it work under confinement.</p>
          <p>However, we&rsquo;ve reached the point in our examples where we&rsquo;re happy with the functionality of our desktop app, and we&rsquo;re ready to focus on its confinement.</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>$ cd ../04-hello-world-desktop
$ snapcraft
$ snap try snap/</code></pre>
          <p>Notice that we don&rsquo;t have to use <code>--devmode</code> anymore. The application looks identical to our previous example, but there&rsquo;s a very important change made to the snapcraft.yaml:</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>    plugs:
      - x11</code></pre>
          <p>The reason we needed to try the previous example in devmode is because when running under confinement, apps don&rsquo;t have access to anything outside the snap, including X. If we tried it without devmode, it would immediately crash as a result. Specifying the x11 plug essentially pokes a hole in the otherwise-complete confinement, telling snappy that this snap requires access to X11.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="eight-col">
          <h3>Let&rsquo;s put it all together in a single snap</h3>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>$ cd ../05-hello-world-combined
$ snapcraft
$ snap try snap/</code></pre>
          <p>The service is running the same as before (just point your browser back to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>), the desktop app is available on your system, you will notice that the command line now is: <code>hello-world-combined-<your-username>.hello-world-cli.</code></p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>apps:
  hello-world-cli:
    command: hello
  hello-service:
    command: hello-world
    daemon: simple
    plugs: [network-bind]
  hello-world-desktop:
    command: qt5-launch hello-world-desktop
    plugs: [x11]</code></pre>
          <p>The reason for this is that the package name is now different from the apps&rsquo; names. In that case, we don&rsquo;t have the simplification of <code><snapname.appname></code> being turned into a single <code><snapname></code> command.</p>
          <p>We also added the network-bind plug to the hello-service webserver in order to inform snappy that it needs to listen to incoming network requests while running under confinement.</p>
          <pre class="command-line"><code>parts:
  cli:
    plugin: cmake
    source: https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft-examples.git
    source-subdir: 01-hello-world-cli/src
  service:
    plugin: nodejs
    source: https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft-examples.git
    source-subdir: 02-hello-world-service
  desktop:
    plugin: cmake
    source: https://github.com/ubuntu-core/snapcraft-examples.git
    source-subdir: 04-hello-world-desktop/src
    build-packages:
      - qtbase5-dev
    stage-packages:
      # Here for the plugins-- they're not linked in automatically.
      - libqt5gui5
    after: [qt5conf] # A cloud part</code></pre>
          <p>The same way we defined multiple apps, we can define multiple parts. You will notice that the code isn&rsquo;t in the snapcraft source project directory directly, but on various external repositories. This turns any source repository like <a href="https://github.com">github</a> or <a href="https://launchpad.net">launchpad</a> into a real open-source store! You can even reference tar files to be downloaded and unpacked!</p>
          <p>If you don&rsquo;t want to reference the whole repository, just specify source-subdir relative to your <code>source. snapcraft help sources</code> will give you more information about this.</p>
